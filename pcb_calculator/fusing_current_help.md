You can use the this calculator to check if a small track can handle a large current for a short period of time.
This tool allows you to design a track fuse but should be used as an estimate only.

The calculator estimates the energy required to heat the wire up to its melting point as well as the energy required for the change of phase.
This energy is then compared to the one dissipated by the wire resistance.
